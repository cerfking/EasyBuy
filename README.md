## Reflection

This was a 3 week long project built during my 5800 Web Development class. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to browse products data both from the mongoDB database and external API. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux.
